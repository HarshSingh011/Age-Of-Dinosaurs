        <h2>What are Dinosaurs</h2>
        <p>Dinosaurs are prehistoric reptiles that have lived on Earth from about 245 million years ago to the present.
        Modern birds are one kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
        <h2>Difference between dinosaurs and reptiles?</h2>
        <p>Dinosaurs lays shelled eggs but reptile eggs does not have any shell </p>

                <p>Sauropoda , whose members are known as sauropods, is a clade of saurischian ('lizard-hipped') dinosaurs. 
                   Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads (relative to the rest of their body), and four thick,
                   pillar-like legs. They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the
                   largest animals to have ever lived on land.Some famous Sauropods are
                   Brachiosaurus, Diplodocus,Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus.</p>

                   in what are now North America, Europe, and Asia, during the Cretaceous Period, although ancestral forms lived 
                   earlier, in the Jurassic.Some famous ceratopsians are Triceratops, Torosaurus, Pachyrhinosaurus, Centrosaurus,

                <P>Technically, paleontologists define raptors, or dromaeosaurs, as theropod dinosaurs that share certain 
                    obscure anatomical characteristics. For our purposes, though, raptors can be broadly described as small- to
                    medium-sized, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaurs equipped with grasping, three-fingered hands, relatively bigl
                    brains, and huge, solitary claws on each of their hind feet, which they probably used to slash and occasionally
                    disembowel their prey. Fun fact they have feathurs on their body just like modern birds</P>

                   three toes and claws on each limb. Theropods are generally classed as a group of saurischian dinosaurs.They
                   were ancestrally carnivorous, although a number of theropod groups evolved to become herbivores and omnivores.
                   Some famous theropods are Allosaurus,segnosaurs,Carharodontosaurus etc. </p>

                   lived from the Late Jurassic Epoch (163.5 million to 145 million years ago) to the end of the Cretaceous Period.
                   Like other sauropods, titanosaurs were herbivorous quadrupeds with long tails, long necks,and small heads. They 
                   differed from other sauropods, however, in that the titanosaursâ€™ bodies were stockier and their limbs produced a
                   wider stance than other sauropods.Some famous titanosaurs are Dreadnoughtus,Patagotitan,Argentinosaurus,
                   Bruhathkayosauru, etc.</p>

                <p>Ankylosaurus is estimated to have been between 6 and 8 meters (20 and 26 ft) long and to have weighed between 4.
                   and 8 metric tons (5.3 and 8.8 short tons). It was quadrupedal,with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low
                   skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward
                   and down. Unlike other ankylosaurs, its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards the front. The front part of
                   the jaws was covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it.It was covered in armor 
                   plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones
                   in the skull and other parts of the body were fused,increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of
                   the genus name.Some famous ankylosaurus are ankylosaurus,polacanthus,souropelta etc.</p>

                   preserved elements are very robust, unusual traits in hadrosaurs. Hadrosaurus were  ponderously-built animals
                   equipped with keratinous beaks for cropping foliage and a specialized and complex dentition for food processing.

                   to modern ostriches. Ornithomimids were fast, omnivorous or herbivorous dinosaurs known mainly from the Late
                   Cretaceous Period of Laurasia (now Asia and North America), though they have also been reported from the Lower
                   Cretaceous Wonthaggi Formation of Australia.The skulls of ornithomimids were small, with large eyes, above 
                   relatively long and slender necks. All had toothless beaks.Some examples are Qiupalong,Sinornithomimus etc. </p>

                   herbivores in the Cretaceous world, dominating the North American land. Their major evolutionary advantage 
                   was the progressive development of a chewing apparatus that became the most sophisticated ever developed
                   by a non-avian dinosaur, rivaling that of modern mammals such as the domestic cow.some famous ornithopods

                   extinction event. The genus Tylosteus has been synonymized with Pachycephalosaurus, as have the genera
                   Stygimoloch and Dracorex, in recent studies.Like other pachycephalosaurids, Pachycephalosaurus was a bipedal 
                   herbivore, possessing long, strong legs and somewhat small arms with five-fingered hands. Pachycephalosaurus
                   is the largest-known pachycephalosaur, known for having an extremely thick, slightly domed skull roof</p>

                <p> Prosauropods weren't simply scaled-down versions of Brachiosaurus or Apatosaurus; many of them walked on two 
                    legs, and there's some evidence that they may have pursued an omnivorous, rather than strictly herbivorous,
                    diet.One of the reason prosauropods are fairly obscure--at least compared to raptors, tyrannosaurs and 
                    sauropods--is that they didn't look all that distinctive, by dinosaur standards. As a general rule, 
                    prosauropods had long (but not very long) necks, long (but not very long) tails, and only attained median 
                    sizes ofbetween 20 and 30 feet and a few tons, max.Some famous of these species are  Efraasia,Melanorosaurus
                    and  Camelotia.

                <p>Stegosaurus is a genus of herbivorous, four-legged, armored dinosaur from the Late Jurassic, characterized by 
                   the distinctive kite-shaped upright plates along their backs and spikes on their tails.They were large, 
                   heavily built, herbivorous quadrupeds with rounded backs, short fore limbs, long hind limbs, and tails held 
                   high in the air.Due to their distinctive combination of broad, upright plates and tail tipped with spikes, 
                   Stegosaurus is one of the most recognizable kinds of dinosaurs. The function of this array of plates and 
                   spikes has been the subject of much speculation among scientists.Some famous Stegosaurus are Stegosaurus

                <p>Therizinosaurus is a genus of very large therizinosaurid that lived in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period.
                   Therizinosaurus was a colossal therizinosaurid that could grow up to 9â€“10 m (30â€“33 ft) long and 4â€“5 m (13â€“16 ft)
                   tall, and weigh possibly over 5 t (5.5 short tons). Like other therizinosaurids, it would have been a 
                   slow-moving, long-necked, high browser equipped with a rhamphotheca (horny beak) and a wide torso for food 
                   processing. Its forelimbs were particularly robust and had three fingers that bore unguals which, unlike 
                   relatives, were very stiffened, elongated, and only had significant curvatures at the tips. Therizinosaurus had
                   the longest known manual unguals of any land animal, reaching above 50 cm (20 in) in length. Some famous of 
                   these species are Alxasaurus,Erliansaurus,Erlikosaurus etc.</p>
